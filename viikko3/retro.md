Since I was working on all the tasks solo, doing a standard team retrospective is a bit challenging, but, I found methods like "Start, Stop, Continue" and the "More of, Less of Wheel" to be quite practical, simply because they force you to clearly identify which of your daily habits are working and which ones are just slowing you down. Besides that, applying the "Glad, Sad, Mad" approach in the future will be a really good way to process my frustration during the hardest parts of the work, rather than just looking at the final results. Overall, great work efficiency boost :)
